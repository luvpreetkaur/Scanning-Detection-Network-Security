Scanning Detection Python project 3 Fall 2019


# Comments

The folder 'My log files' contains the scanned files with windows xp and victim metas data
This folder is also included in the 'Scanning detection' folder so as to read the .log files  in the code.
I have made seperate dictionaries for ip, time and ip, port so as to compare the data
The hacker's data and time has been fetched and printed within the code.The code for writing data in the file is commented at the last(I was facing redundant printing issues when I was trying to write the data in the report)
